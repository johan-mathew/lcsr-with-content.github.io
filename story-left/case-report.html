        <h1>LCSR Case Report</h1>
        <div class="underline"></div>
        <p>Faheema Shirin, a 3 rd semester B.A student of the Sree Narayanaguru College, Chelannur, Kozhikode
            was troubled by a rule change instituted by the college authorities which would have her and her
            fellow students compulsorily surrender their mobile phones between 6 pm and 10 pm. The rule
            would have her surrender a crucial learning aid that most of the students of her age take for
            granted. Faheema and a group of friends approached the authorities, yet was met with a cold
            shoulder, and when it became clear that she was not going to relent, the authorities turned
            increasingly hostile, threatening that any student who couldn’t abide by their rules could vacate
            their hostels. Even after meeting with her parents, who stood by Faheema’s demands, the
            authorities stubbornly refused to roll back their rule and in the end Faheema was forced to vacate
            her hostel room.
        </p>
        <p>With the college authorities staying emboldened at what they viewed to be their victory, Faheema
            approached LCSR (Legal Collective for Student Rights) for legal recourse. The organization which has
            in previous years frequently represented student grievances identified several legal paradigms that
            the rule restricting mobile phone usage seemed to violate. Firstly, according to the plaintiff, the rule
            was exclusively exercised in the women’s hostel, which amounted to discrimination on the basis of
            gender, and thus was in violation of Clause 5 of UGC Student Entitlement Guidelines; the UGC
            (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education) Regulations, 2012; Conventions on Elimination of All
            Forms of Discrimination against Women, 1979 (“CEDAW”); Beijing Declaration; and the Universal
            Declaration of Human Rights. Furthermore, the restriction on the use of internet by students went
            against the Kerala Government’s policy of promoting digital learning from the school level, evident
            from the numerous policy declarations provided through official means and social media such as
            Facebook. Additionally, the rule deprived the student of her source of knowledge – the internet –
            which would be a detriment to her quality of education. Also, it could be argued that the right to
            access the internet forms a part of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article
            19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India, the restrictions of which covered by Article 19(2) cannot be
            extended to include the problematic rule devised and enforced by the college authorities. Moreover,
            the enforced surrender of her mobile phone is an invasion of a citizen’s fundamental right of privacy
            guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. In addition, the modification of the rules
            governing the students primarily through parental conviction and assent could be argued to be an
            infringement of the personal autonomy of the adult student.
        </p>
        <p>The plaintiff, represented by Adv. Legith T.Kottakkal, approached the High Court of Kerala, which
            presided over by Justice P.V Asha ruled in favour of the plaintiff. The Justice established in her
            judgement that “the students in a college hostel are adults who are capable of taking decisions …”,
            that “the college authorities as well as the parents cannot be permitted to shut their eyes on the
            innumerable advantages out of internet …”, and that “a student above the age of 18 years shall be
            given the freedom to choose the mode for her studies provided it does not cause any disturbance to
            others.” The Justice further states that the “enforcement of discipline shall not be by blocking the
            ways and means of the students to acquire knowledge” and ends with the caution to students that
            their “exercise [of right to privacy] does not invade the right to privacy of another student …”. The
            Justice in her concluding statements decreed that such restrictions were “unreasonable” and
            demanded that the plaintiff be re-admitted in the hostel without delay.
        </p>
        <p>The implications of the judgement are obvious: it sets an important precedent for the use of internet
            within India, and has conferred on its citizens important legal ammunition against authoritarian
            control of the internet, be it by minor authorities or the State itself – another arrow has been gifted
            to the quiver of students’ rights.
